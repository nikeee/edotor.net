This site uses:
- [`dot-language-support`](https://github.com/nikeee/dot-language-support) for its language capabilities
- [`monaco-editor`](https://github.com/Microsoft/monaco-editor) as main editor component
- [`Viz.js`](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js) to render the graph

*Want to add a language support feature?* Head over to the repository of [`dot-language-support`](https://github.com/nikeee/dot-language-support).

*Think the website is cool?* There is also a language server! You can use the same language capabilities in your favourite editor! Have a look at [`dot-language-server`](https://github.com/nikeee/dot-language-server).
